Architecture
Comparing Frontend Development Techniques:

In our full stack project, we utilized a blend of Express HTML, JavaScript, and a Single-Page Application (SPA) framework, each serving distinct purposes:

Express HTML: This was primarily used for creating server-side rendered pages. Its simplicity and directness are suitable for static pages where dynamic interactivity isn't a primary concern.
JavaScript: As the scripting language for web pages, JavaScript was indispensable for adding interactivity, handling events, and manipulating the DOM in both server-rendered pages and the SPA.
SPA (Angular): The SPA approach, implemented via Angular, allowed for a more dynamic, application-like user experience. It excels in creating responsive interfaces with minimal server communication for data updates.
Choice of NoSQL MongoDB Database:

We chose a NoSQL MongoDB database for its flexibility and scalability. Its schema-less nature allowed us to rapidly iterate our data models without being constrained by rigid relational structures. This agility is particularly beneficial in full stack projects that evolve rapidly.
Functionality
JSON vs. JavaScript and Its Role in Frontend and Backend Integration:

JSON vs. JavaScript: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON's syntax is derived from JavaScript, but it's language-independent and can represent simple data structures and associative arrays.
Role in Integration: JSON serves as the common language between frontend and backend. It's used for sending data from the backend (in a database like MongoDB) to the frontend and vice versa. Its universal format ensures seamless data serialization and parsing.
Refactoring for Improved Functionality and UI Component Reusability:

During the project, we refactored code to enhance functionality and efficiency. For instance, consolidating similar functions and modularizing repeated code into reusable components.
Benefits of Reusable UI Components:
Efficiency: Reduces the amount of redundant code, speeding up the development process.
Maintainability: Easier to maintain and update a single component than multiple instances of similar code.
Consistency: Ensures UI consistency across different parts of the application.
Testing
Understanding of API Testing Methods, Endpoints, and Security:

API Testing: Involves testing various aspects like HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), ensuring correct response status, and verifying the response payload.
Endpoints: Each API endpoint corresponds to a specific function, such as retrieving data or processing a user request. Testing ensures that these endpoints correctly handle requests and responses.
Security Considerations: Security testing is crucial, especially for protecting sensitive data. This includes testing for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and ensuring proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.
Reflection
Impact of the Course on Professional Goals:
